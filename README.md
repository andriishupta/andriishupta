I efficiently build fast, reliable software applications relying on my 8 years of experience as a full-stack web developer. TypeScript, React, Next.js, Supabase, Node.js, NestJS, Tailwind.

I have worked for startups building early MVP products from scratch as well as maintaining legacy features in enterprise software.

I'm quick to adapt to any technology stack.

I know Svelte, Angular, Astro, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Redis, Kafka, AWS and Vercel ecosystems, different headless CMS, chrome extension development, and more. I have experience with languages like Java, Kotlin, Python, and PHP. I hold a degree in Computer Science.
